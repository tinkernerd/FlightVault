> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and skill development after earning a pilot certificate, focusing on improving landings, practicing abnormal procedures, and flying more to enhance proficiency.

## Continuously Improve Your Landings

1. Make a plan to improve your landings.
2. Examine your landings with a critical eye by considering the following:
	1. **Speed:** Ensure your pattern speeds are correct and consistent through all legs.
	2. **Aiming and Touchdown Points:** Maintain discipline to select aiming and touchdown points for every landing and make those touchdown points.
	3. **Flare and Touchdown:**
	    1. Appropriately trade airspeed for altitude in the form of a shallower descent in the flare.
	    2. Touch down as the wings stall.
	4. **Runway Alignment:** Be on centerline with the longitudinal axis parallel to the runway.
	5. **Go-Arounds:**
	    1. Follow your own rules for a stable approach.
	    2. Execute a go-around when appropriate.
3. Judge your improvement on the quality of your "bad" landings.
4. Practice under a variety of conditions like wind, configuration, and time of day to better hone your visual cues and mastery of the airplane.

## Practice Abnormal Procedures

1. Read the insightful section of your POH that includes an expanded discussion of abnormal and emergency procedures.
2. On your next flight:
    1. Review the table of contents for the emergency section.
    2. Select an event you haven't practiced.
    3. Follow the checklist for that item.
    4. Understand the "why" behind it.
3. This exercise will prepare you for real-time abnormals and ensure a better understanding of your aircraft's systems.

## Fly More

1. There's nothing better for proficiency than to fly more and visit new places.

Remember, earning your pilot certificate is just the beginning. Continuously learning and refining your skills through practice will enhance your aviation experiences and provide even greater personal enrichment.
