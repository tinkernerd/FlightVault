This section covers the use of remote communications with ground facilities, emphasizing how pilots can maintain effective communication even when not in direct line-of-sight with ground stations.

## Line-of-Sight Communications:

1. VHF radio communications operate line-of-sight between aircraft and ground stations.
2. Most ground stations are equipped with extensive communication gear on site.

## Remote Communications Outlets (RCOs):

1. Communications can occur through RCOs when not line-of-sight with the facility:
    1. Example: In the Redfish Lake area, communicate with the Boise Flight Service Station via the Stanley RCO on frequency 122.6.

## NAVAIDs with Communication Capabilities:

1. Many NAVAIDs have built-in communications capabilities:
    1. Example: Near Falmouth, Kentucky, transmit to the Louisville Flight Service Station on 122.1 and listen over the VOR frequency 117.0.
2. NAVAIDs without voice capability have their frequency underlined on charts.

## Troubleshooting Communication Issues:

1. If you don't receive a response on a frequency:
    1. Try contacting the same facility using a different frequency.
2. Utilize technology to find frequencies:
    1. GPS receivers and aviation apps have databases of ATC and Flight Service frequencies.
    2. They can save time when searching for alternate frequencies.

Remember, staying connected with ground facilities is crucial for safety, especially when operating outside direct line-of-sight communication ranges.
