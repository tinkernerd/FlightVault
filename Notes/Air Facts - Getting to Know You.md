This section emphasizes the importance of building a strong relationship with air traffic controllers and how it benefits pilots, especially new student pilots.

## Getting to Know Air Traffic Controllers:

1. Establish relationships with controllers:
    1. You will work closely with them over the radio.
    2. Meeting them in person enhances communication and understanding.
2. Visit control facilities:
    1. Towers, TRACONs, or centers welcome pilot visits.
    2. Controllers will explain any procedures or answer questions.
3. Benefit from direct interaction:
    1. Controllers will try to accommodate your requests during flights.
    2. Understanding their procedures helps when they cannot fulfill a request due to regulations or traffic conflicts.

## Enhancing Communication Skills:

1. Improve communication by interacting with controllers:
    1. Direct contact sharpens your communication skills.
    2. Knowing a few controllers makes all interactions more relaxed.
2. Engage with controllers in group settings:
    1. Invite a controller to speak at your local flying group meetings.
    2. Learn collectively and address common questions.

## Professionalism and Resolving Concerns:

1. Recognize controllers as professionals:
    1. They are dedicated to assisting pilots to the best of their ability.
    2. Avoid assuming they are against pilots; they are there to help.
2. Handle flight concerns appropriately:
    1. Do not dispute issues over the radio frequency.
    2. If needed, wait until after landing to call and discuss any concerns.
    3. Often, after some reflection, you may find a call isn't necessary.

Remember, building a rapport with air traffic controllers enhances safety, improves communication, and makes your flying experience more enjoyable.
